# Salon Black & White

This repository contains the Salon Black & White application.
The Next.js frontend lives in [`frontend/`](frontend/), while the Nest.js backend
is located in [`backend/`](backend/).

The original Laravel-based frontend has been archived in
[`archive/laravel-frontend`](archive/laravel-frontend) and is no longer
maintained.

## Developing the frontend

The Next.js development server can be started with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install    # only required once
npm run dev
```

You can also run it in one line:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
