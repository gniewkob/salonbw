# Salon Black & White

This repository contains the Salon Black & White application.
The Next.js frontend lives in [`frontend/`](frontend/), while the Nest.js backend
is located in [`backend/`](backend/). The original Laravel-based frontend was
moved to [`archive/laravel-frontend`](archive/laravel-frontend) and is no longer
maintained.

## Developing the frontend

Run the Next.js development server with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install    # only required once
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
