# Salon Black & White Frontend

This directory contains the Next.js application.

## Installation

Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file with the API URL used by the frontend:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Available scripts

Run these commands from the `frontend` folder:

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run lint` – check the code with ESLint
- `npm run format` – format source files with Prettier

## Placeholder routes

The `src/pages` directory contains placeholder pages for the following routes:

- `/` (home)
- `/about`
- `/appointments`
- `/clients`
- `/dashboard`
- `/employees`
- `/login`
- `/products`
- `/reviews`
- `/services`

Each page currently just renders simple text and can be expanded later.
